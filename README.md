In this research, we would like to explore and measure situated empathy regarding an international community in a foreign country through a virtual reality experiment to increase domestics' understandings and international communities' quality of life in the society. To achieve our research purposes, we designed a VR experiment with three main stages: Data Collection, Pre-experiment Questionnaire, and Post-experiment Questionnaire with a structured interview.

Our research demo "We Are Oulu: Exploring Situated Empathy through a Communal Virtual Reality Experience" has been ACCEPTED into the publication 2022 IEEE Conference on Virtual Reality and 3D User Interfaces!
